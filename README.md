Navigation in Jetpack Compose Codelab - Rally App
==================================================

This Codelab helped me learn how to add Jetpack Compose navigation to the Rally app and get familiar with its key concepts. 
Also learned how to set up a navigation graph of composable destinations, define navigation routes and actions, pass additional information to routes via arguments, set up deep links and test navigation.
